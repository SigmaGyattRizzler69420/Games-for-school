SIDTheScienceKidâ€”"Fun HTML games for school, and they can't be blocked because they are files. None of these files are mine, but I have spent the past couple of years researching to get these files. I have compiled them all here because of this. Please do not edit files, and if you want, share them. The link below is even more games in a Google Doc. There are a lot, and also, it is not mine; there is a link to who made it. Also, the Google sites are both my websites if you look at the highlighted letters in order and type them up in the search box you will be able to go to secret sites. If you are confused then I will share a video."
