SIDTheScienceKidâ€”"Fun HTML games for school, and they can't be blocked because they are files. None of these files are mine, but I have spent the past couple of years doing research to get these files. I have compiled them all here because of this. Please do not edit files, and if you want, share them. The link below is even more games in a Google Doc. There are a lot, and also, it is not mine; there is a link to who made it." https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhphSnhrkPw5XNqSCh3b4i11VqiDlO6HK_NWcSnkQK8/edit?usp=sharing
